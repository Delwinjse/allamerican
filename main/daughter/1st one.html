            <div class="username">Posted by <strong>Kate_Johnson02</strong> in <strong>r/AskParents</strong></div>
            <div class="post-body">
<p>I stopped my daughter (Emma, 15) from being trafficked last week. Obviously, that sounds like I did a good thing - but my sister doesn’t think so. I could really use a second opinion on this.</p>

<p>So Emma used to be such a well-behaved girl. Always top of her class, polite, and cheerful. We’d always say we got lucky with her.</p>

<p>But things changed when she started hanging with a new friend group…</p>

<p>I know she’s at that age as well, but it’s really bad.</p>

<p>She doesn’t listen to a word me or my partner says anymore. She’s been breaking rules we’ve set and going out late without telling us where or who with.</p>

<p>I’ve overheard her talking on the phone to boys (men?) late at night.</p>

<p>I don't know if its her new friend group or tiktok, but she's had some bad influences lately.</p>

<p>It all came to a head when she went out one night and didn’t tell us. She’s supposed to text us where she is and who with. She wasn’t answering any phone calls, so obviously, I was concerned. There's been reports of r*pes and trafficking happening in the area too.</p>

<p>I decided I couldn't just sit there and called the police as I had no idea where she was.</p>

<p>Emma came home 30 minutes later, dropped off by some older guy I’ve never seen before. She flipped out on me, saying I overreacted and that I shouldn’t have called the police.</p>

<p>She refused to even talk to me, even though I was looking out for her safety. It felt like I couldn’t even recognize my daughter, let alone look after her.</p>

<p>But anyway, onto the main part of the story.</p>

<p>So last week, Emma decides to sneak off at night again, even though she’s grounded.</p>

<p>I was in an impossible position since she would make me look like the bad guy if I called the police again. But as a mom, I had to make sure she was safe.</p>

<p>That’s when my partner reminded me of something. When Emma got her phone a few years ago, she agreed to have a tracking software on there for safety. It tracks locations and can even read messages. We hadn’t even used it because we hadn’t had any issues. I completely forgot we even had it.</p>

<p>It’s completely hidden too; she can’t even see the app, let alone delete it. I’m sure she had forgotten about it, like I did. So I knew she still had it on her phone.</p>

<p>I never wanted to be the mom who tracks her kids’ phones, but I had to make sure she was safe. I also didn’t want to call the police again unless there was a real problem.</p>

<p>I found her location at some house I didn’t recognize. I also saw from her messages that she was with some guy who was 23! I won’t go into detail, but I could tell from the messages that his intentions weren’t good.</p>

<p>I decided to call the police again, but this time with proof and the location. They took me seriously when I told them about the messages, and they were there in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Turns out the guy was linked with some trafficking gangs. He was also found with dr*gs in the house, so the police took him away.</p>

<p>When police brought Emma home, she wasn’t angry like I was expecting her to be. Instead, she was crying and apologizing.</p>

<p>It was only when the police explained the crimes he was linked to that she realized what she got herself into. It was some serious stuff and it must have scared her.</p>

<p>We had a long talk after that. I didn’t even shout or anything because she knows how bad she messed up.</p>

<p>She says she doesn’t ever want to go back to the friends she was with and actually admitted that I was right to look out for her safety (can you believe it?!).</p>

<p>Ever since the incident, she’s been on her best behavior, even though she’s grounded. I think she’s been trying to make it up to us, as she’s been doing all the chores and keeping her room tidy without even asking.</p>

<p>She goes to school, comes back home, and does her homework—that’s it. And while she’s still shaken up, I feel like I’m finally getting my Emma back again.</p>

<p>Now, here’s the dilemma. Emma doesn’t know I tracked her phone. My husband and most of my friends think I did the right thing. Some of them even downloaded the app after hearing my story.</p>

<p>But my sister says that Emma’s too old to have a tracker on her phone. She thinks I should tell Emma and get rid of the app.</p>

<p>And while I agree that she’s old enough for her privacy, surely keeping the app on her phone for her safety is the right thing to do? I don’t read her texts 24/7. It’s just there for emergencies. What do you guys think?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A ton of people are asking me about the app on her phone. It’s called <a href="https://americancitizenoffers.com/main/daughter/?cmc_redir=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.mspy.click%2Faff_c%3Foffer_id%3D2%26aff_id%3D21078%26aff_sub%3D%5Bcmc_vid%5D"  id=click>Mspy</a>. You can use it on iPhone or Android, and it can read messages from basically every messaging app (even Instagram/Snapchat). And if they’re under 18, it’s 100% legal even if they don’t know about it. 100% recommend! <a href="https://americancitizenoffers.com/main/daughter/?cmc_redir=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.mspy.click%2Faff_c%3Foffer_id%3D2%26aff_id%3D21078%26aff_sub%3D%5Bcmc_vid%5D"  id=click>Use this link to try it.</a>.</p>          </div>
