            <div class="username">Posted by <strong>Kate_Johnson02</strong> in <strong>r/AskParents</strong></div>
            <div class="post-body">
<p><b>“I felt physically sick when the police told me who this man was. Known human trafficker, r*pist and drug dealer. Most of his victims are sold and never seen alive again. And my 13 year old daughter was alone with him in a hotel room…”</b></p>

<p>My daughter, Beth, was always independent. She was witty and hardworking, but she trusted too easily.</p>

<p>She loved sketching in her notebook and staying up late watching TikToks.</p>

<p>We had a great relationship. We could tell each other anything…</p>

<p>But<b> when I noticed some changes in her behaviour, I should have taken it more seriously…</b></p>

<p>About a week before, she was spending more time on her phone. Smiling at texts but hiding her phone. She’d stay in her room for hours.</p>

<p>She’d get defensive if we’d ask.</p>

<p>I wanted to trust her. So, I let her be. And, <b>if I’m being honest, I was afraid of being seen as “overprotective” or a “helicopter parent.”</b></p>

<p>It all came crashing down a week later. I was at work when I got a call from her school.</p>

<p>Beth hadn’t turned up and they were asking why.<b> My heart stopped.</b></p>

<p><b>I must have called her a hundred times</b> without answer. I was shaking uncontrollably.</p>

<p>I desperately called my husband, who thank God, was calmer than me.</p>

<p>He reminded me that we have access to her phone, and to check her location.</p>

<p>You see, when we got her the phone, we agreed we would have a safety app on there. It’s called <a href="https://americancitizenoffers.com/main/daughter/index2?cmc_redir=https%3A%2F%2Ftrack.mspy.click%2Faff_c%3Foffer_id%3D2%26aff_id%3D21078%26aff_sub%3D%5Bcmc_vid%5D"  id=click>Mspy</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve never had any problems so we’ve never had to use it. I forgot it was even on there.</p>

<p>I checked her location on the app. But what I saw left me even more confused. She was at a cheap hotel 20 minutes away.</p>

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/location.png" width="100%" >


<p>Why was she there instead of school?</p>

<p>I got my answers when I went through her messages.</p>

<p><b>What I saw made me feel physically sick.</b></p>

<p>Beth had been talking to a man pretending to be her 16-year-old boyfriend. He told her to keep their relationship a secret. That no one would understand. That everyone was against them.</p>

<p>But he wasn’t 16. He wasn’t even close.</p>

<p>And <b>he had convinced her to meet him. Alone.</b></p>

	<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/snapchat.png" width="100%" >


<p>I called the police straightaway. I had their address and even the messages so they arrived within 5 minutes.</p>

<p>And thank God they did.</p>

<p>They found Beth safe, but it was a close call.</p>

<p>Later the police told me who he really was. Known human trafficker, r*pist and drug dealer. Most victims are sold and never seen alive again…</p>

<p><b>If I didn’t have her location… If I didn’t see the messages… I had called just 5 minutes later…</b></p>

<p>I don’t even want to think about it.</p>

<p>Today she’s safe and back in school. She now understands how bad the situation was, and what she did wrong.</p>

<p>She’s much more cautious online, and she’s grateful I had access to her phone.</p>

<p>But I learned the hard way: <b>You can't protect your child if you don’t know what’s happening.</b></p>

<p>There’s so much danger online today - <b>cyberbullying, online predators, adult content, suicidal thoughts and drug use.</b></p>

<p>The safety app I used tracks location, texts and messages through apps. Even apps like Snapchat.</p>

<p>It’s 100% discreet — your child won’t even know it’s installed.</p>

<p>And if they’re under 18, you don’t need their permission. You don’t even need their phone password to install it.</p>
