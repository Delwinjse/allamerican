            <div class="username">Posted by <strong>Kate_Johnson02</strong> in <strong>r/AskParents</strong></div>
            <div class="post-body">
        <p>Hear me out. I never thought I would be the mom who tracks her kid’s phone.</p>
        <p>I always believed that “children should have independence” and “it’s important for them to have privacy.” <u>All of the things you believe before you have actual problems.</u></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my son (Jamie, 15) has been hanging out with the wrong crowd over the past year. One of the boys (Ricky) is older, and his parents have been arrested a few times.</p>
        <p> <u>Something about Ricky never sat right with me.</u> He’s disrespectful, and I’ve heard some awful stories about him (he’s been involved with the police). I’m terrified of Jamie going down that path. He rarely talks to me anymore and doesn’t tell me where he’s going.</p>
        <p>I’ve caught Jamie lying to me a few times and breaking rules we’ve set (text us if you’re going to be home later than 8). He’s unfortunately at that age where I just can’t get through to him, and I never know what he’s up to.</p>
        <p>I know kids rebel a bit when they’re teenagers, but this is different.<u> I even caught him with vapes and a cigarette butt</u> in his room, which is when I knew this was a real problem.</p>
        <p>He just refuses to talk to me or even acknowledge that he’s doing anything wrong. He just denies that it's his. We’ve even tried talking to his teachers, but they haven’t been able to do much.</p>
        <p><u>I know that as a mom, I have a responsibility to make sure he’s safe and to know what he’s up to…</u></p>
        <p>But this is where I might have overstepped a line. Last week, while he was in the shower, I saw that he left his phone unlocked.</p>
        <p>I don’t really know what I was thinking, but I decided to put a tracker on his phone (yes, it’s legal). I heard about one that’s undetectable, so I knew he couldn’t remove it or even know he had it on his phone.</p>
        <p>The next day, I tried to call him when he was out with his friends (we agreed he would pick up when he’s out), but he didn’t pick up.</p>
        <p>That’s when I decided to check the app. It showed that he was at a park almost an hour away, NOT at his friend’s house like he said he would be. But the app also lets you read his texts, so I decided to take a look.</p>
        <p><u>I saw Jamie and Ricky talking about smoking we*d at the park.</u> I was furious.</p>
        <p>I decided it was time for him to face the consequences of his actions and called the police. It’s decriminalised where I am, so I knew he wouldn’t get arrested, but I was hoping it would shake him up a bit - which is exactly what happened.</p>
        <p>He obviously had no idea I called the police or even tracked him, so when the police came and rounded them up, he was more than a bit shocked.</p>
        <p>When the police dropped him home,<u> he had his head hung in shame</u> and could barely look at me. I think he thought he was going to jail for real, and that really put things into perspective.</p>
        <p>We had a proper talk about his actions after (first one in what feels like years), and I can tell he realises he messed up. <u>He even gave us a sincere apology</u>, which I almost can’t believe.</p>
        <p>He hasn’t been hanging out with Ricky anymore (I’ve checked). He goes to school and straight back home—that’s it. He’s even been working hard on his schoolwork.<u> I think he’s determined to make up for his actions.</u></p>
        <p>The only people he’s talking to are some kids that I know and trust.</p>
        <p>And while I feel like a proud mom for getting him out of trouble, one of my friends thinks I shouldn’t have tracked him.</p>
        <p>My husband agrees with me and thinks,<u> as a mom, I have a responsibility to keep him safe.</u> A lot of my friends agree with me too.</p>
        <p>But now I’m having second thoughts. Was I wrong in using the tracker?</p>
        <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> A LOT of people have been asking me about the discreet tracker I used, so I’ll leave a link <a href="https://example.com/mspy" target="_blank">here.</a> It’s called <a href="https://example.com/mspy" target="_blank">MSpy</a>, and it works on iPhone or Android. It can track basically all messaging apps as well as their location—100% recommend!</p>            </div>
